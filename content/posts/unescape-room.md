TIL about [unescape() room](https://unescape-room.jobertabma.nl/), a game that
helps we improve our *Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)* skills through challenges.

It's based on real world examples and becomes increasingly more difficult as
each level progress. The page links to a video that explains the vulnerability
and helps us to start the game. Give it a try!
