      <description>TIL about the at command. It allows us to schedule commands to be executed at a later time.
$ echo &amp;#34;bla&amp;#34; | at now + 5 minutes or if you want to execute commands from a file later on:
$ at -f path/to/file 9:30 PM Tue We can type atq to see existing jobs. For more information check man or tldr, it&amp;rsquo;s a really interesting suite of commands.</description>

      <title>The ps -o flag</title>

      <description>The ps command is well known for displaying process information, but it was only recently that I found out about the useful -o flag. What this flag does is display the information about one or more selected headers.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see an example where we display the rss (Resident Set Size) for the process with pid 5380:
$ ps -o rss -p 5380 RSS 1784  rss represents the real memory, that is, the process&amp;rsquo;s memory that is held in RAM.</description>
