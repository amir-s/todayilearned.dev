      <description>TIL about the at command. It allows us to schedule commands to be executed at a later time.
$ echo &amp;#34;bla&amp;#34; | at now + 5 minutes or if you want to execute commands from a file later on:
$ at -f path/to/file 9:30 PM Tue </description>

      <title>The ps -o flag</title>

      <description>The ps command is well known for displaying process information, but it was only recently that I found out about the useful -o flag. What this flag does is display the information about one or more selected headers.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see an example where we display the rss (Resident Set Size) for the process with pid 5380:
$ ps -o rss -p 5380 RSS 1784  rss represents the real memory, that is, the process&amp;rsquo;s memory that is held in RAM.</description>

      <title>Vim :normal</title>

      <description>Sometimes it is useful to use the :normal command in VIM, what it does is accept a sequence of keys and pretend they were typed in normal mode.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see how this works with a quick example. Suppose we have a file like the following:
1 abc,123 2 bcd,4 3 cde,54321 4 def,88 And we want the end result to be:
hash[&amp;#34;abc&amp;#34;] = 123 hash[&amp;#34;bcd&amp;#34;] = 4 hash[&amp;#34;cde&amp;#34;] = 54321 hash[&amp;#34;def&amp;#34;] = 88 To solve this in one command we can select the lines we want to modify and use:</description>

      <description>TIL about the &amp;amp; command in Vim and how it can be used to repeat the last search and replace pattern.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see how this works with a quick example. Suppose we have a file like the following:
rock paper scissors rock paper scissors rock paper scissors And you want to replace the word rock with lizard just in the lines one and three (don&amp;rsquo;t ask me why). Normally I would do something like:</description>
